# Determined & Metaflow

This repository outlines how Metaflow can be used to pre-process data, train a deep learning model on a Determined cluster, and serve the outputted model artifact.

`example-determined.py` provides the template FlowSpec, with steps to:
1. Preprocess and transform the data (placeholder)
2. Train the model on a Determined cluster
3. Upload the checkpoint artifact to a serving endpoint (placeholder)

## Preprocess and Transform Data

Placeholder


## Training on Determined

The step will:
* pull a Github repository with the model code
* start an experiment on a Determined cluster using the model code
* wait for the experiment to complete
* return details of the experiment for downstream use


## Serving
